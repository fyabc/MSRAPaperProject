## A Seq2Seq Chatbot

fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

A chatbot based on seq2seq model, implemented by Theano, based on the Google paper [A Neural Conversational Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869).

The training dataset can be found here: [Cornell Movie--Dialogs Corpus](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)

========
##How to Use
First, have theano installed.

Download the dataset above, make a new folder called `data` for it.

To prepare the data for training, run `make_convs.py`.

Next run `build_model.py` to train:
>$THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python build_model.py

Note that the last few lines are commented out, which illustrate how to make a `Chatbot` instance with a `model` instance, and to talk to the chatbot instance by simply passing it a string.
